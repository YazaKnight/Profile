I like coding, I sometimes code in the weekends and on holidays. I like coding because it teaches me how computers work and how developers make websites. It also teaches me problem solving.\\

I started learning Python last year. I like Python because it is an easy language to understand and learn about programming. It also is widely used in machine learning and AI software.

Here is a piece of code I've written in Python:

```

Here's another code I wrote to draw on the screen:

Lately, I have been working on an autonomous car with my mum. The car shall self-drive and shall be able to interact with the user. Currently, we have wired a Raspberry Pi to an Arduino that controls the motors on the wheels of the car. The Raspberry Pi recieves directions signals from an iOS app that we developed, and sends that to the Arduino board to control the car. The car has ultrasound sensors which we programmed to stop when nearing an obstacle. In the next stage, we will connect a camera to the car and write the python code needed for facial recognition as well as detecting obstacles (and taking action on that). You can find the code of this project in [this repository](https://github.com/HebaNAS/Yezoo).
